**🚗 Parking Management System**

**📌 Project Overview**

The Parking Management System is a Java-based project designed to automate the process of managing parking spaces. It helps allocate spots efficiently, generate tickets, and handle payments — reducing manual errors and saving time.

**🎯 Problem Statement**

Manual parking systems often face challenges such as:

Difficulty in tracking available spots.
Confusion during peak hours.
Time delays in issuing tickets and payments.
This project solves these problems by providing an automated and structured approach.

**👥 Target Users**

Shopping malls,
Office buildings,
Universities & colleges,
Public parking lots.

**🛠️ Features**

Allocate and track parking spots.
Generate parking tickets for vehicles.
Support for multiple vehicle types (Car, Bike, etc.).
Simple payment handling system.
Admin access to manage parking spots.

**🧑‍💻 OOP Concepts Used**

Encapsulation: Data such as spot status, ticket details, and payment info are hidden inside classes.

Inheritance: Vehicle is the parent class; Car and Bike are subclasses.

Polymorphism: Same methods handle different types of vehicles.

Abstraction: Generic methods like pay() and reserveSpot() are defined and specialized later.
