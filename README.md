**🚗 Parking Management System**

**📌 Project Overview**

The Parking Management System is a Java-based project designed to automate the process of managing parking spaces. It helps allocate spots efficiently, generate tickets, and handle payments — reducing manual errors and saving time.

**🎯 Problem Statement**

Manual parking systems often face challenges such as:
Difficulty in tracking available spots
Confusion during peak hours
Time delays in issuing tickets and payments
This project solves these problems by providing an automated and structured approach.

**👥 Target Users**

Shopping malls
Office buildings
Universities & colleges
Public parking lots

**🛠️ Features**

Allocate and track parking spots
Generate parking tickets for vehicles
Support for multiple vehicle types (Car, Bike, etc.)
Simple payment handling system
Admin access to manage parking spots

**🧑‍💻 OOP Concepts Used**

Encapsulation: Data such as spot status, ticket details, and payment info are hidden inside classes.
Inheritance: Vehicle is the parent class; Car and Bike are subclasses.
Polymorphism: Same methods handle different types of vehicles.
Abstraction: Generic methods like pay() and reserveSpot() are defined and specialized later.

**📊 UML Diagrams**
Class Diagram: Shows the main entities like ParkingLot, ParkingSpot, Vehicle, Ticket, and PaymentSystem.

Use-Case Diagram: Shows interactions of Driver and Admin with the system.

**Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ParkingManagementSystem.git
Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).
Run the Main.java file to start the system.

**📌 Future Enhancements**

Add real-time sensors for spot detection
Mobile app integration
Online reservations and payments
